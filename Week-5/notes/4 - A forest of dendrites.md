Can you speculate how $r_{i}$ changes as the diameter of a dendrite increases?

It increases.
It decreases.
It does not change.
Depends on the cell type

Answer:
It decreases.

Explanation:
As the diameter of a dendrite increases there is more "room" for the charge to flow, meaning the resistance to current is decreased, similar to how water moves faster through a wide pipe than it does through a thin pipe.

How about as r_{m} as the number of channels increases along the membrane?

It increases.
It decreases.
It does not change.
Depends on the cell type.

Answer:
It decreases.

Explanation:
As the number of channels increases along the membrane that allows for more current to flow which means a reduction in membrane resistance.

We can call the neurons that receive coincident inputs from both ears "coincidence detectors." If you hear a sound that seems to come from your left, which coincidence detectors were most likely activated?

The coincidence detectors closer to your left ear.
The coincidence detectors closer to your right ear.
Coincidence detectors in the middle.
All of the coincidence detectors.

Answer:
The coincidence detectors closer to your right ear.

Explanation:
A sound that comes from your left enters your left ear first. The signal from your left ear then has more time to travel down the delay line leading to your coincidence detecting neurons. This signal gets further along the delay line before it meets the signal from your right ear, which began slightly after the signal from your left ear. Thus, the two signals meet at a coincidence detecting neuron that is closer to the right ear, and your brain infers that the sound came from your left.
