```
Can you identify the fixed point or points in this phase plane?
At the origin.
At the leftmost point of each nullcline
At the lowest point of each nullcline
At the intersection between the two nullclines

At the intersection between the two nullclines

Similar to our simple linear model, $V_{0}$ would occur at the location where all rates of change are 0, that is where $\frac{du}{dt}$ and $\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$, which is the intersection of the u nullcline and V nullcline (red and green curves).

These concepts can be difficult if you have not encountered them before. Let's recap, if you like. Earlier in the lecture we saw a system with only one dimension (voltage), and we represented the system as movement (or flow) along a line. The direction and speed of flow was determined by the $\frac{dV}{dt}$ function that we plotted. The system was attracted to stable fixed points and repelled away from unstable fixed points. Now we have a system with two dimensions, V and u, and correspondingly we represent the system as flow in a 2-dimensional plane (the phase plane). Both $\frac{dV}{dt}$ and $\frac{du}{dt}$ are defined at every point in the plane, although we cannot show the curves for these derivatives like we could when we only had one dimension. Instead, we plot the curves that show where the derivatives are 00 (these are the nullclines) to give a sense of the system's structure. Similar to our one-dimensional case, our two-dimensional system flows toward the fixed point. But, as you will see, sometimes the system travels through the phase plane in interesting ways.
