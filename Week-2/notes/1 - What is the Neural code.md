Recording from the brain:
Examples: 
1. functional Magentic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
fMRI helps in approximately discovering the regions of neural activity.
The recorded responses were slow.
2. Electroencephalography (EEG)
Here, The recorded responses are fast,
because it helps in electrically capturing the neural circuits in the brain much faster.

Question:
fMRI and EEG are useful because they can noninvasively record neural activity in awake and behaving humans. 
What is a limitation of these techniques?
Answer:
Neither of them can record the activity of individual neurons.
Explanation:
These techniques are useful because they are easy to perform on all sorts of test subjects non-invasively as both kinds of signals can be read through the skull and scalp. 
Also, all organisms with brains, including humans, produce these kinds of signals, which is useful for researchers in that they can compare similar activity in anatomically homologous regions of the brain across individuals of the same species. 
However, as we are not recording directly from single neurons, the signals are averages of the approximate activity of large groups of neurons and so the exact timing and location of responses can be difficult to discern.

Question:
Preforming the patch clamp technique is difficult and requires quite a bit of finesse. 
Can you speculate why a researcher would want to record the internal activity of a single neuron instead of merely recording external signals?

Yes

Explanation:
Action potentials (and other activity) recorded internally have higher recorded amplitudes as a result of the proximity to the changes in voltage. Activity recorded externally is of lesser amplitude and requires much amplification because voltage changes decay quickly over short distances. 
Also, when patched onto a small portion of the plasma membrane of a neuron, a researcher has the ability to discern the properties of single ion channels, as seen in the diagram. 
Additionally, some internal recording techniques allow for the injection of certain chemicals and ions to which the researcher can record a change in internal activity of the patched cell.

Question:
In a raster plot such as the one just shown, 
in which a short experiment is repeated many times, 
what does a vertical structuring of the dots at one point in time indicate?
Answer:
The cell fires very consistently at that time (with respect to each iteration of the stimulus).
Explanation:
A vertical bar in the raster plot indicates a strong response, meaning that one cell fires very reliably at a particular time during the stimulus presentation, and suggesting that the cell is responding to the particular feature of the stimulus that occurs at that time. Weaker responses are represented by thin red bars (where the cell fires during some iterations but not others). 
As such, a weak response indicates that there is something about the feature (orientation of a bar of light in the video for example) that the cell likes, but is not the feature it responds to best (the orientation is off by a few degrees from what the cell prefers, for example).

Encoding and Decoding:
-- Encoding
How does a stimulus cause a pattern of responses?
Answer: Building quasi-mechanistic models.
P(reponse | stimulus)
-- Decoding 
What do these responses tell us about the stimulus?
How can we reoconstruct what the brain is doing?
P(stimulus | response)

Question:
If the stimulus in question is an audio recording of someone speaking a certain syllable, 
which of the following could be an appropriate choice of stimulus parameter?
Answers:
(i) The average amplitude of the signal. 
(ii) The relative amplitude of two frequency components in the signal.
Explanation:
In general there are a multitude of different stimulus parameters that could affect a neuron's response. 
Part of designing a good experiment involves picking a natural set of parameters to investigate while holding all others as constant as possible. 
With neurons in lower cortical areas, it is often relatively easy to figure out what parameters are important (e.g., the location of a spot of light for a neuron in LGN). 
In higher cortical areas, however, it can be quite difficult to understand exactly what parameter of a stimulus a neuron is tuned to.
