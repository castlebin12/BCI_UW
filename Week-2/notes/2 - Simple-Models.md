## Simple Models
### Basic coding models: 
```
1. linear response
The response of the time is highly dependent upon the stimulus of the time.
s(t) -> r(t)
```
### 2. Temporal filtering

#### Question:
Since this is a linear system, 
which of the following will always be true?
#### Answers:
(i) If you scale the input by a constant, the output will be scaled by the same constant. 
(ii) The output of a sum of different inputs is equal to the sum of the outputs of each of the individual inputs.

```
Examples of temporal filtering:
1. Calculating average
2. Calculating leaky average
```
```
### 3. Spatial filtering
Hint: Apply temporal filtering to the time

### 4. Spatiotemporal filtering

#### Question:
Which of the following inputs might cause a linear system with a positive filter to predict a negative firing rate?

#### Answer:
An input that slowly varies between a large positive value and a large negative value.
