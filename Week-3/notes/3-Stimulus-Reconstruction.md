## Stimulus Re-construction

Imagine that this is our Spike Triggered Average (STA).
Everytime when there is a spike, the spike train is being measured.

```
Qustion:
In the equation s_bayes = \int{ds*p[s|r]*s}, s_bayes is a function of the stimulus s.

Answer:
False

```

When working with an expression involving an integral, remember that the expression is not a function of the variable that is integrated ove

Question:
In this experiment, what do r and s represent?

Answer:
the fMRI signal, the video clip

Explanation:
r represents the response, or firing rate of a neuron. So generally it measures brain activity. 
s represents the stimuli that elicited that brain activity. In this case, the fMRI was used to measure the brain activity, and the video clips were used to elicit it. 
How would you figure out the dimensionalities of the vectors rr and ss?
