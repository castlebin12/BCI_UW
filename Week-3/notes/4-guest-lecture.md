Retina cell --- where visual processing begins.
Photo-receptors are transduced and converted into electrical responses.
The rand photo-receptors are receptive to dim light.
The cone photo-receptors helps in extending higher visual levels.
The signals produced in the rand and cone segments are processed by serveral layers of cells within the retina before passing to the optic nerve of the brain.
The few photons are coming-in are being absorbed within a pool of several 100s upto 1000s of rods generate electrical signals which are not only reliably detective with the retina, but it sends to brain with reliable perception.

So, what are we looking for is,
The threshold of retaining the non-linearity of signals on rods from the photons, where it ejects noise from the remaining rods.
It's the case where in the nervous systems over the aspects of convergence of many inputs on downstream cell and those small subset of inputs where all those outputs are generating noise.

Advantages:
```
```
1. Access to rod signal and noise properties, 
where it measure the response of the rods of single photons. 
We can measure the noise of the rod responses and
We can summarize it by constructing the distributions that capture the probability of the given rod generates the amplitude responses,
where we can plot it as the probability versus the amplitude.
For those in black curve, the rod failed to absorb the photon that's being generating noise.
For those in red curve, the rod absorbs the photon that's being generated as single photons.

This helps in giving a theoritical prediction of how to make selection of signals and noise.

2. Circuitry points
-- The circuitry points are likely the location at synapse between rods and rod bipolar cells.
-- Rod bipolar cell seems to receive multiple inputs.
Combination of multiple inputs in a linear manner.

3. Direct recording
-- Majority of rod single photon responses were rejected.

The plots above were kinda misleading...
```
```
Here is an improved way of representing the distribution.

```
Now, the question is,
What will happen to the visual threshold (like 1 in 1000 rods absorb the photons)?
The second chart shows it (in the above diagram).
The maximum amplitude is gained from the rod associating with the noise and then, associating with signal.
This helps in predicting the position of non-linearity.
