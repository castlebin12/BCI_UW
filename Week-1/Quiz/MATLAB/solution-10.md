Suppose we wish to generate a 2x3 matrix that contains only zeros. 
Which of the following expressions would achieve this goal? 
Select all the correct answers.
```
```m
>> A=[0,0,0;0,0,0]

A =

     0     0     0
     0     0     0

>> A=zeros(2)

A =

     0     0
     0     0

>> A=zeros(3)

A =

     0     0     0
     0     0     0
     0     0     0

>> A=zeros(3,2)

A =

     0     0
     0     0
     0     0

>> A=eye(2,3)

A =

     1     0     0
     0     1     0

>> A=zeros(2,3)

A =

     0     0     0
     0     0     0

>> A=[0 0 0; 0 0 0]

A =

     0     0     0
     0     0     0

>> A=[0 0; 0 0; 0 0]

A =

     0     0
     0     0
     0     0
