1. Computational Neuroscience
-- Characterizing "what" nervous system do
-- Determining "how" they function
-- Understanding "why" they operate in particular ways
```
```
2. Types of computational models
-- Descriptive Models ("what")
-- Mechanistic Models ("How")
-- Interpretive Models ("Why")
```
```
3. Examples:
Models of Receptive Fields
(Responses of a neuron in an intact cat brain)
Mechanism
-- Using electrode from the brain, the electrical signals are recorded from the brain.
-- These electrical signals that generated as outputs are in the form of digital pulses known as spikes.

4. Question:
This describes a model of a specific neuron in a cat responding to visual stimuli. 
Which of the following functions most accurately depict the model we are talking about here? 
Remember: y = f(x) means that y is a function of (depends on) x.
Answer:
Frequency of spikes = f(Light bar's orientation)
Explantion:
In computational terms, this model is defined by a function, which we can estimate mathematically. 
In this case, we are trying to estimate an encoding function - one which converts a stimulus into a neurological response. 
A greater response corresponds to more frequent "spikes" (also known as "action potentials") being generated by the cat's neuron. 
So the function we would estimate in this case is: 
Frequency of spikes = f(Light bar's orientation). 
We refer to the "receptive field" of a neuron as the particular orientation of a bar of light that produces the best response (that is, maximizes f(Light Bar's orientation)).

5. Receptive field:
-- Specific properties of a sensory stimulus generating a strong response from the cell.
Examples:
- Spot of light over particular location on the retina
- Bar of light over particular orientation and location on the retina.

6. Question:
When a cell has an "on-center, off-surround" receptive field, 
which center is being referred to?
Answer:
The center of the small patch of retina associated with the cell.
Explanation:
Each cell tends to respond to light input in only a small area of the retina and visual field. 
An on-center, off-surround cell becomes more active when only the center of this area is illuminated and less active when the only edges of this area (the surround) are illuminated. 
Generally a cell is not affected much by input in far away areas of the retina (although recent studies have begun to show that some subtle long-range communication may exist).

7. Question:
The On-Center / Off-Surround receptive field can be thought of as a filter. 
This filter results in more activation due to certain stimuli, and a depression in activation due to other stimuli. 
What is this particular filter doing?
Answer:
Causing activation with stimuli concentrated on the center of the receptive field, 
and depressing activation with stimuli which are concentrated in the surround
Explanation:
This filter is causing more activation when the light is concentrated in the center of the receptive field, and less when more light on the outside. 
Later, we will show how these filters can be thought of as simple mathematical operations.
