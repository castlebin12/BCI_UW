Neuron Doctrine:
-- Neuron is the fundamental structural & functional unit of the brain.
-- Neurons are discrete cells, but not continuous.
-- The information flows from the dendrites to the axon via the cell body.

Question:
What are the characterisitics of the idealized brain model?
Answers:
(i) The brain is broken into individual, discrete parts called 'neurons.' 
(ii) The shape of neurons varies in some general way from one area of the brain to another. 
(iii) Dendrites are the input ends of the neuron, whereas axons are the output ends.

Question:
Spikes (output) from a neuron occur when?
Answer:
The sum of inputs from neighboring neurons reaches a certain threshold.
Explanation:
Generally, you can think of the neuron as summing over all of its inputs over time and location along its dendrites. 
When that sum reaches a high enough point, the cell is said to "fire" a spike.

Neuron:
-- Neuron is a leaky bag of charged liquid.
-- The contents are enclosed within a cell membrane.
-- The cell membrane is a lipid bilayer,
 where it's impermeable to charged ion species such as Sodium(Na), Chlorine(Cl) & Potassium(K).
-- The ionic channels are embedded in cell membrane where the ions are allowed to flow in or out.
-- Each neuron maintains a potential difference across it's membrane,
where the inside has about -70mV relative to the outside.
Na & Cl has higher outside as well K & organic anions(A) higher inside.
The ionic pump maintain -70mV difference by expelling Na out & allowing K ions in.

How can the electrical potential be changed in local regions of a neuron?
Answer: Ionic channels
```
```
Ionic channels:
-- The ionic channels are embedded in cell membrane where the ions are allowed to flow in or out.
-- The ionic channels are gated which are as follows:
(i) Voltage-gated
Probability of the opening depends upon the membrane voltage.
Voltage-gated channels--
- Depolarization: a positive change in voltage.
- Polarization: Negative change that causes spike or action potential.
(ii) Chemically-gated
Binding to a chemical causes the channel to open.
Eg: Synapses
(iii) Mechanically gated
Sensitive to pressure or stretch.
```
```
Question:
Spikes (output) from a neuron occur when?
Answer:
Other neurons' outputs cause some of this neuron's gates to open and allow in a different concentration of ions, which leads to a strong depolarization and increases the chance of a spike.
