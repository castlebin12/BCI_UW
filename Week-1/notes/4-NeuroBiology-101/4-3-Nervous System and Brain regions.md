Nervous Systems:
```
```
Types:-
Pheriperal Nervous System and Central Nervous System
```
```
Pheripheral Nervous System consists of Somatic and Autonomic nervous systems.
```
```
The Somatic system is where the nerves connect towards the "voluntary skeletal muscles and sensory receptors".
The nerves are the bundle of axons.
Sensory receptors consist of Afferent Nerve Fibers (incoming) and Efferent Nerve Fibers (outcoming).
Afferent Nerve fibers are the incoming ones where the axons carry information away from the pheriphery to the Central Nervous System (CNS).
Efferent Nerves Fibers are the outgoing ones where the axons carry information from the CNS outward to the pheriphery.
```
```
Autonomic nervous system is where the nerves connect to the internal organs such as the heart, blood vessels, smooth muscles and glands.
It operates below the level of consciousness.
It exhibits various functions such as the heart rate, digestion, respiration rate and so on.
```
```
Central nervous system consists of the spinal cord and brain.
```
```
Spinal Cord:
-- Local feedback loops control reflexes known as the reflex arcs.
-- Descending motor control signals from the brain activate the spinal motor neurons.
-- Ascending sensory axons convey the sensory information from the muscles and the skin back to the brain.

BRAIN REGIONS:
```
```
1. Hindbrain
(i) Medulla Oblangata: Controls breathing, muscle tone and blood pressure.
(ii) Pons: Connected to the cerebellum. It's involved in sleep and arousal.
(iii) Cerebellum: Co-ordination and timing of the voluntary movements, sense of equilibrium, language, attention, etc

```
2. Midbrain and Reticular formation
(i) Midbrain focus on eye movements, visual and auditory reflexes.
(ii) Reticular formation modulates the muscle reflexes, breathing & pain perception. Also, sleep regulation, wakefulness & arousal.

```
3. Thalamus and Hypothalamus
(i) Thalamus is the relay station for all the sensory information (except smell) to the cortex and also, regulates sleep/wakefulness.
(ii) Hypothalamus regulates the basic needs such as Fighting, Fleeing, Feeding and Mating.

```
4. Cerebrum
-- It consists of cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus and amygdala.
-- It's involved in perception and motor control, cognitive functions, emotion, memory and learning.
```
```
-- Discussing parts of cerebrum in detail:
(a) Cerebral cortex:
- The cerebral cortex is the layered sheet of neurons.
- It's about 1/8th of an inch thick.
- Approximately 30 billion neurons.
- Each neuron makes about 10,000 synapses with a total of approximately 300 trillion connections.
- Cerebral cortex has 6 layers of neurons that are relatively in uniform structure.
- As a computational neuroscience researcher,
Is there a common computational principle operating across the cortex? (A question to ask ourself and research on it)

How do all of these brain regions interact to produce cognition and behavior?
Answer not yet discovered, but there are bunch of possible techniques such as:
(i) Electrophysiological
(ii) Optical
(iii) Molecular
(iv) Functional imaging
(v) Psychophysical
(vi) Anatomical
(vii) Connectomic
(viii) Lesion (brain damage) studies
```
```
Neural Computing (vs) Digital Computing
(i) Device count:
Human brain: 10^11 neurons (each neuron approximately 10^4 connections)
Silicon chip: 10^10 transistors with sparse connectivity.
(ii) Device speed:
Biology has 100Us (U expressed as Meuuu & s is seconds) temporal resolution.
Digital circuits has 100ps clock (10 GHz)
(iii) Computing Paradigm:
Brain: Massively parallel computation & adaptive connectivity.
Digital computers: Sequential information processing via CPUs with fixed connectivity.
(iv) Capabilities:
Digital computers excel in math & symbol processing.
Brains: Better at solving ill-posed problems such as speech & vision.
