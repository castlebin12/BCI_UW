Synapse:
-- Synapse is termed as the connection or junction between two neurons.
-- Synapse doctrine: Synapse form as the basis for "memory" and "learning".
-- Types: Electrical synapses and Chemical synapses.
-- The electrical synapses use gap junctions.
-- The chemical synapses use neuro-transmitters.
```
```
Electrical Synapses:-
-- The electrical synapses use gap junctions.
-- The mechanism can be related to the connectivity that is done through cell phones or computers.
```

-- Mechanism of Electrical Synapses:

```
Explanation of the mechanism:
(i) The Neurons A & B are connected where the gap junctions serves as an interface between them.
(ii) The yellowish thingies are the ionic channels like where the Sodium (Na) ions migrate from Neuron A to Neuron B passing through gap junction.
(iii) It provides fast connections.

Chemical Synapses:-

```
Explanation of the mechanism:
Suppose if we have Neuron A and Neuron B,
The Spike (action potential) is passed through Neuron A.
The bags found on Neuron A are known as vesicles that are filled with Neuro-transmitter molecules.
So, when the spike hits through the vesicles, these bags releases the molecules towards the junction.
The junction area filled with these molecules are known as the Synapic claft.
These molecules fuse with the receptors, where the receptors are the chemically-gated ionic channels.
Then, the channels will gradually open after the fusion, where they allows the ions to enter inside or outside depending upon the concentration.
```
```
Chemical Synapses (vs) Electrical Synapses:
The chemical synapses are those more predominantly used in things like memory formation as these chemicals also have the ability to alter synaptic interactions in the synaptic cleft, 
whereas the electrical synapses are a means by which networks of neurons can coordinate and in some cases synchronize, their outputs.

```
Explaining the beautiful picture:
Each of the bright spots corresponds to a synapse,
where the typical neuron has around 10,000 synapses on dendrites of the cell body.
The synapses can be either excitatory or inhibitory.
The excitatory synapse is the one that has the ability to increase the postsynaptic membrane potential.
Whereas, the inhibitory synapse does the opposite of the excitatory synapse.

How the synapses play an important role in memory and learning?
The brain learn through Synaptic plasticity.
```
Hebbian Plasticity: <br><br>
![](http://geekresearchlab.net/coursera/neuro/synapse-5.jpg)<br>
```
-- Proposed by a Canadian Psychologist.
-- If Neuron A repeatedly takes part in firing Neuron B, then the synapse from A to B is strengthened.
-- Crazy saying: Neurons that fire together wire together.
```
```
Examples, where plasticity plays an important role:
1. A young child learning its first language 
2. Practicing your kung fu enough to make it second nature 
3. Studying for your examinations 
4. Bicycling more timidly after a bad bicycle accident
