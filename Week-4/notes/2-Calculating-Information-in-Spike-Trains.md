Question:
Take a moment to imagine the possible effects of this jitter. 
Take a guess about which statement is true (or all of the above):

Answers:
Some is to be expected as a result of noise inherent in neural activity. 

Information about a stimulus can still be reliably transmitted if jitter exists. 

The greater the width of this jitter, the less confident we are that the cell is accurately representing the stimulus.

Explanation:
All of these statements are true. Biological systems, including neural systems, exhibit variability. 
Excess variability can corrupt neural signals, making them less reliable. 
However, neural systems deal with this variability in fascinating ways, sometimes reducing this "noise" as much as possible within fundamental physical limits. 
Certain neural systems even use noise to their advantage. 
We will touch on just a small number of examples of these incredible adaptations in this course.

Question:
Can you recall how to compute the entropy of the response?
Answer:
Total entropy - noise entropy
